2014-08-08  Release 1.10.0

2014-08-07  Release 1.9.0

    related metrics measure that quality attribute.
  * Bug fix: ignore revisions created by Maven on tags when checking for

    a keyword parameter.

    an upper bound on the number of cases that do not meet the criteria.
    The metrics changed are the metrics for measuring whether user stories and 
    logical test cases are reviewed and approved, whether user stories have
    enough logical test cases, and whether logical test cases to be automated
    are actually automated.

2014-06-25  Release 1.3.0

  * Don't use the term key performance indicator (KPI) since there are way too 
    many metrics to justify usage of the phrase "key". Consequently, the main

    date.
